      <h1>Clay Morsey Jr.</h1>
      <h2>Ryan Blake | Writer</h2>
      My name is Clay Morsey Jr. and I am a writer from Norwalk, Connecticut. I am a graduate of The Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute, where I studied Method acting, writing and directing. During my time at Strasberg I frequently wrote video shorts that were often selected to be produced during class. I have had a passion for writing since a young age and always look for ways to push the boundaries of what can be achieved. After working on an independent feature in New York City last summer, I decided to to create a production of my own. Vishnu and I currently have two projects that are in the works. Both revolve around a group of diverse individuals trying to survive when they are forced out of their comfort zones. As a writer, I have a habit of creating characters that are out of their element. As people I believe that we all at one point develop a routine and a comfort zone. It’s only when that routine and comfort disappears that we truly see ourselves for who we really are. Throughout my life I have had to constantly change and adapt to meet others’ expectations, something that has never been easy for me. Regardless, it has made for some interesting tales and has enabled me to insert a small piece of myself into each new work I create. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6462516/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t13"><img src="../img/icons/imdb.png" alt="imdb" id="imdb"></a> </div>
