      <h1>Vishnu Prasad</h1>
      <h2>Krish Shetty</h2>
      My name is Vishnu Prasad and I’m an Indian-born writer and director from Stamford, Connecticut. I’ve lived in India, England and the US. Growing up in three different countries has it’s side effects. I don't see the world like everyone else and I have always felt like an outsider. Through these experiences, one of the things that i’ve learned was that even though on the outside many things are different, we are more alike than we realize. All of these adventures have helped me in creating deep and interesting characters and the worlds they live in. After graduating from Business school and landing a desk job, I soon realized what I truly wanted to do with my life. I quickly shifted my focus and started learning more about filmmaking. Although I have been writing and creating stories from the age of 8, I never thought I could make a living as a filmmaker. After honing my skills by working on several independent film projects, I wrote and directed my first short film with a $0 budget and minimal crew. Now it’s time to take the next step. After teaming up with my writing partner, Clay Morsey, we believe that we have created an interesting and humorous story that will resonate with anyone who’s ever felt like they’ve been on the outside, or on the inside for that matter. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6526882/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t7"><img src="../img/icons/imdb.png" alt="imdb" id="imdb"></a> </div>
