       <h1>Jon Abrado</h1>
      <h2>Derrick Wilson</h2>
      My name is Jon Abrado, an American actor, published model, & comedian, from Stamford, CT. I'm playing Derrick, one of the supporting roles of "The Pointe". Derrick is THE smoothest and coolest guy around, and I am very excited to help bring him to life. I have been involved in the arts primarily my entire life.  From a young age, I found myself surrounded by anything that included being in front of an audience, whether it was school musicals, plays, dance acts, and talent shows. That all transpired later on in life, to what I am truly passionate about now, which is TV&Film. I am fascinated by the process of turning stories into live action realities for the audience. Most of my previous work consists of print advertisement, TV&Film background, and commercial work. ESPN, Sprint, Budlight, NFL, Macy's, and KMart are some of the biggest clients I have had just to name a few. Working with some of the production team in the past is going make this process that much more fun, and I can't wait to see how much trouble Derrick can keep Jason out of at The Point.<br><br>
