      <h2>Jason Crouse</h2>
      My name is Justin Younts. I play Jason, one of the leads in The Pointe. I'm extremely excited about the role. I've been with the production since the beginning. Jason is a role I can bring to life. He's the type of person you can hate and love at the same time.This is one of the reasons that I was drawn to him. As for myself, I am originally from Charlotte, North Carolina. I've been in New York City for four years. I studied at The Neighborhood Playhouse and The Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute. I've been in London and studied Perdekamp Emotional Method. Since being in NYC, I've worked in short films. I played Nick in Whiskey Soda, Sport in Holly's Not Home, Ray in Trustworthy, and Bruce in Sunset Psycho. As well as in theatre, I played Antonio in Twelfth Night, Victor in Dead End, and Petruchio in The Taming of the Shrew. I am looking forward to working with the cast and crew on the Pointe. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5031916/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t12"><img src="../img/icons/imdb.png" alt="imdb" id="imdb"></a> </div>
