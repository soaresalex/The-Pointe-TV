      <h1>Tony Republicano</h1>
      <h2>Mr. Dumas</h2>
      Tony Republicano is thrilled to be back in front of the camera doing his first love, no, not his sexy The Pointe wife… comedy! His long and so called “career” has included: Plays and Musical Theatre - Sisters Rosensweig, Lend Me a Tenor, Annie, Film - The Adderall Diaries, Amazing Spiderman 2, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and Television - The Last Laugh-a comedy pilot for Jimmy Fallon, W.W.E., O.I.T.N.B. and any other New York filmed show that has policemen, prison guards or mafia. Tony brags that he shared a cell on death row with Mike Tyson on Law and Order (sadly his big scene was cut) and that like most of his film and TV credits you can not blink during the show or you’ll miss him. When he’s not performing educational theatre, or playing patients for YALE Medical School he likes to instruct IMPROV comedy workshops. He loves working with the wildly funny cast of The Pointe, and says he doesn’t mind being one of the oldest characters on the show. "Afterall", says Tony, “they don’t call me Daddy for nothing!” <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm9175344/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t8"><img src="../img/icons/imdb.png" alt="imdb" id="imdb"></a> </div>
