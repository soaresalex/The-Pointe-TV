      <h2>Producer | Mrs. Dumas</h2>
      My name is Paulina Simkin and I'm an actress, producer and pianist originally from Europe. After getting my Master's in Piano Performance from The Juilliard School I decided to add an acting degree from The Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute and it was the best decision of my life. Ever since that I have been acting in feature films, TV shows, commercials, I produced a couple short films and sometimes I even get to play the piano in my projects. And like Mrs. Dumas, I also like to swing... Being part of The Pointe and making it succeed is a matter very close to my heart! I believe it is a unique and at the same time very relatable story that needs to be told. I love our team and would love for everyone to join our incredible journey. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5927276/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t1"><img src="../img/icons/imdb.png" alt="imdb" id="imdb"></a> </div>
