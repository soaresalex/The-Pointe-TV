      <h2>Designer | Photographer</h2>
      My name is Elizabeth Viggiano and I'm the set designer and photographer for The Pointe. After receiving a BFA in Photography at MassArt in Boston, I started a photography business mostly revolving around weddings and fashion. I approached weddings with cinema in mind, focusing on various narratives that the guests created. To me, it felt like a movie production coming together that I had to make sense of visually.At that, I always had a passion for staging scenes in my images. I grew up in an old Stamford, Connecticut home filled with antiques, art, and confusing design. There were things everywhere and most of my upbringing consisted of restaging rooms constantly to find "order" in it all. I like to think of this as the base that stemmed my photography journey. I can't wait for my "Pointe" of view to come across in this upcoming series!
